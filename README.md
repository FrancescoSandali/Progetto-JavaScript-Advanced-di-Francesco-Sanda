😎ABOUT THE PROJECT

This is an app for encourage people to read

🔢HOW IT WORKS

It has a search bar where you can write the subject of a book and the application will return 50 books of that subject, e.g. (love, adventure, horror etc...).
When the card appear you can see the cover, title and author of the book. There is also a button and if you click on it you will be directed to a page with the details.
In this page there are the cover, ratings and a description of book.
